# Feature Specification: GUI Podcast Studio

**Feature Branch**: `001-gui-podcast-studio`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an application that generates a podcast based on various selected content forms: webpages, documents, etc. so AI generates the text, calls chosen TTS provider, like ElevenLabs, in the chosen format (e.g., solo, two-person conversation, interview-style), and assists with all the production, uploading, RSS feed generation and validation for a hosted website from a GUI. Build off the codebase that exists currently, but extend it to meet this more DIY user experience."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Podcast Generation (Priority: P1)

A content creator wants to transform a collection of blog posts and articles into an audio podcast episode without writing any code or using command-line tools.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling non-technical users to access the existing podcast generation capabilities through a user-friendly interface. Without this, the GUI has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting content sources (URLs/files), configuring basic settings (voice, format), and generating a single podcast episode that can be played back locally. Delivers immediate value as a content-to-audio converter.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has launched the application, **When** they paste a URL or upload a document, **Then** the content is validated and added to the content queue
2. **Given** the user has added content sources, **When** they select a podcast format (solo/conversation/interview) and TTS provider, **Then** the configuration is saved and ready for generation
3. **Given** the user has configured content and settings, **When** they click "Generate Podcast", **Then** the system processes the content and produces a playable audio file
4. **Given** podcast generation is in progress, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** they see real-time progress updates for each stage (content extraction, transcript generation, audio synthesis)
5. **Given** a podcast has been generated successfully, **When** the user clicks the completed episode, **Then** they can preview the audio and download the file

### User Story 2 - Multi-Episode Management (Priority: P2)

A content creator wants to manage a library of podcast episodes, edit episode metadata, and organize their content before publishing.

**Why this priority**: Once users can generate episodes, they need to manage and organize them. This enables batch production and quality control before publishing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating multiple episodes, editing their titles/descriptions, reordering them, and previewing the collection. Delivers value as an organizational tool independent of publishing features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has generated multiple episodes, **When** they view the episode library, **Then** they see a list of all episodes with titles, durations, and creation dates
2. **Given** the user views an episode, **When** they click "Edit Metadata", **Then** they can modify the title, description, episode number, and publication date
3. **Given** the user has multiple episodes, **When** they drag-and-drop episodes to reorder them, **Then** the episode sequence is updated
4. **Given** the user selects an episode, **When** they click "Regenerate", **Then** the system recreates the audio using the same content but allows updated settings
5. **Given** the user has unwanted episodes, **When** they select and delete them, **Then** the episodes are removed from the library

---

### User Story 3 - Podcast Publishing & RSS Feed (Priority: P3)

A content creator wants to publish their podcast episodes to S3 hosting and generate a valid RSS feed that can be submitted to podcast directories like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

**Why this priority**: This completes the end-to-end workflow from content to published podcast. While important, users can still create valuable audio content without publishing features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a set of episodes to S3, generating an RSS feed, and validating it against podcast directory standards. Delivers value as a distribution mechanism.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has completed episodes, **When** they configure podcast metadata (show title, author, description, artwork), **Then** the podcast identity is saved
2. **Given** the user has configured S3 credentials, **When** they select episodes and click "Publish to S3", **Then** the audio files and RSS feed are uploaded to the S3 bucket
3. **Given** episodes have been uploaded, **When** the RSS feed is automatically generated, **Then** a valid RSS 2.0 feed is created with all episode details and hosted on S3
4. **Given** an RSS feed has been generated, **When** the user clicks "Validate Feed", **Then** the system checks the feed against podcast directory standards and reports any issues
5. **Given** a valid RSS feed exists, **When** the user clicks "Copy Feed URL", **Then** they receive the public S3 URL to manually submit to podcast directories
6. **Given** the user wants to update published episodes, **When** they modify episode metadata and republish, **Then** the changes are reflected in the S3-hosted RSS feed and audio files

### User Story 4 - Advanced Content Configuration (Priority: P4)

A content creator wants fine-grained control over how content is processed, including custom conversation styles, speaker personalities, and content filtering.

**Why this priority**: Power users will want customization beyond basic formats. This is an enhancement that builds on the core generation capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating custom conversation templates, adjusting TTS voice parameters, and generating episodes with different configurations. Delivers value through personalization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user wants a specific conversation style, **When** they create a custom conversation template with custom prompts and speaker roles, **Then** the template is saved and available for episode generation
2. **Given** the user is generating a conversation-style podcast, **When** they configure individual speaker personalities and voice settings, **Then** each speaker has distinct characteristics in the output
3. **Given** the user has content with irrelevant sections, **When** they configure content filtering rules, **Then** the specified content is excluded from transcript generation
4. **Given** the user wants consistent branding, **When** they configure intro/outro audio clips, **Then** these are automatically added to all episodes

---

### User Story 5 - Batch Processing & Templates (Priority: P5)

A content creator wants to automate repetitive workflows by creating templates and processing multiple content sources in batches.

**Why this priority**: This is a productivity enhancement for regular users who have established workflows. It's valuable but not essential for initial adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a project template with saved settings, importing a batch of URLs, and generating multiple episodes with one action. Delivers value through automation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has a regular workflow, **When** they save their configuration as a template, **Then** the template includes content sources, format, TTS settings, and metadata defaults
2. **Given** the user has a saved template, **When** they create a new project from the template, **Then** all settings are pre-configured
3. **Given** the user has a list of URLs or files, **When** they import the batch and apply a template, **Then** the system queues multiple episodes for generation
4. **Given** batch processing is running, **When** the user views the queue, **Then** they see progress for each episode and can pause/resume/cancel individual items

---

### User Story 6 - Audio Snippets & Composition (Priority: P6)

A content creator wants to save reusable audio snippets (intros, outros, midrolls, ads, music) and compose them into a complete podcast episode either automatically via AI-driven layout or manually via drag-and-drop editor.

**Why this priority**: Professional podcast branding requires consistent intros/outros and ad placement. This elevates generated podcasts from basic content conversion to professional-quality productions. While valuable, core generation works without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading audio snippets, creating an episode layout template, and generating a podcast with snippets automatically positioned. Advanced users can manually arrange snippets in a visual editor. Delivers value through podcast professionalization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user wants to add branding, **When** they upload an intro audio file, **Then** the snippet is saved to their library with metadata (name, type, duration)
2. **Given** the user has saved snippets, **When** they create an episode layout template, **Then** they define snippet positions (pre-roll intro, mid-roll ad at 50%, post-roll outro)
3. **Given** the user has an episode layout template, **When** they generate a podcast, **Then** the AI-generated content and saved snippets are automatically merged according to the template
4. **Given** the user wants manual control, **When** they open the episode composition editor, **Then** they see a visual timeline with the main podcast audio and can drag-and-drop snippets into position
5. **Given** the user has positioned snippets in the editor, **When** they preview the composition, **Then** they can play the complete podcast with all snippets merged at the specified positions
6. **Given** the user is satisfied with the composition, **When** they save the layout, **Then** the snippet positions are stored and can be applied to future episodes
7. **Given** the user has multiple snippet versions, **When** they select a snippet for placement, **Then** they can choose which version to use (e.g., "intro_v1.mp3" vs "intro_v2.mp3")

### User Story 7 - Platform Distribution & Automation (Priority: P7)

A content creator wants to automatically distribute their podcast episodes to major platforms (Spotify, Apple Podcasts) and integrate with workflow automation tools for custom distribution pipelines.

**Why this priority**: This is an advanced feature for users who want streamlined multi-platform distribution. Most users can manually submit RSS feeds to directories, making this a convenience enhancement rather than core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting platform accounts (Spotify for Podcasters), configuring automation webhooks (n8n/Zapier), and verifying episodes are distributed to configured targets. Delivers value through automated distribution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user wants platform distribution, **When** they connect their Spotify for Podcasters account via OAuth, **Then** the platform is added as a distribution target
2. **Given** the user has connected platform accounts, **When** they publish an episode, **Then** the episode is automatically submitted to all configured platforms
3. **Given** the user wants custom automation, **When** they configure an n8n or Zapier webhook URL, **Then** the webhook receives episode data (audio URL, metadata, RSS feed) upon publishing
4. **Given** the user has multiple distribution targets, **When** they view an episode, **Then** they see the distribution status for each platform (pending, published, failed)
5. **Given** a platform distribution fails, **When** the user views the error, **Then** they see a clear error message and can retry distribution
6. **Given** the user wants to remove a platform, **When** they disconnect the account, **Then** future episodes are not distributed to that platform but existing episodes remain
