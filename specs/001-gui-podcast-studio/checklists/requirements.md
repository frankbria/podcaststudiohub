# Specification Quality Checklist: GUI Podcast Studio

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Updated**: 2025-10-20 (After clarification on hosting approach)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**User Clarifications Resolved**:
1. **Hosting approach** (FR-009): Clarified as three-tier model:
   - Primary: AWS S3 hosting (default)
   - Platform distribution: Direct integration with Spotify, Apple Podcasts via OAuth
   - Automation: Webhook support for n8n/Zapier workflows

**Updates Made**:
- Added User Story 6 for platform distribution and automation (Priority P6)
- Expanded functional requirements (FR-009 through FR-011) to cover S3, platform APIs, and webhooks
- Added Distribution Target entity to Key Entities
- Updated edge cases to cover OAuth token expiration, platform API limits, webhook failures
- Added success criteria for distribution features (SC-011 through SC-013)
- Updated assumptions to reflect S3 as primary hosting and platform account requirements

## Next Steps

The specification is ready for:
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan
- `/speckit.clarify` - Ask additional clarification questions (if needed)
